# Spotify Scraper


##  Overview
Python **Spotify Web Player Scraper**, a fast high-level Spotify Web Player Scraper, to scrape and extract data from Spotify Web Player with the most efficient and fastest methods.
instead of using Selenium, I used [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) library to increase the speed of scraping.
You can set cookies, headers and proxy and download the cover and preview mp3 song of Spotify songs beside the scraping.
