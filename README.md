print(f"Track: {track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']}")

# Download preview
file_path = client.download_preview(track["id"])
print(f"Downloaded preview to {file_path}")

# Download cover image
cover_path = client.download_cover(track["id"])
print(f"Downloaded cover to {cover_path}")
```

client = SpotifyClient()

# From URL
track = client.get_track("https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")

# From ID
track = client.get_track_by_id("6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")

# Access track data

print(f"Artist: {track['artists'][0]['name']}")
print(f"Album: {track['album']['name']}")
print(f"Release date: {track['release_date']}")
print(f"Preview URL: {track['preview_url']}")
```

### Extract Album Information

from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()

# Get album info
album = client.get_album("https://open.spotify.com/album/1DFixLWuPkv3KT3TnV35m3")

# Access album data
print(f"Album: {album['name']}")
print(f"Artist: {album['artists'][0]['name']}")
print(f"Release date: {album['release_date']}")

# Get all tracks in album
for track in album['tracks']:
    print(f"- {track['name']}")
```

### Extract Artist Information

```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()

# Get artist info
artist = client.get_artist("https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb")

# Access artist data
print(f"Artist: {artist['name']}")

    print(f"- {track['name']}")
```

### Extract Playlist Information

```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

    print(f"- {track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']}")
```

### Download Preview MP3

```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()

# Download with default settings
path = client.download_preview("https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")

# With custom filename and path
path = client.download_preview(
    "6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6",
    filename="my_song.mp3",
    path="~/Music",
    with_cover=True,  # Embed cover art
)
```

### Download Cover Image

```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()

# Download with default settings
path = client.download_cover("https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")

# With custom filename, path and size
path = client.download_cover(
    "6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6",
    filename="album_cover.jpg",
    path="~/Pictures",
    size="large",  # 'small', 'medium', or 'large'
)
```

### With Authentication

```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

# Create authenticated client
client = SpotifyClient(
    auth_token="your_spotify_auth_token",
    # or
    cookie_file="path/to/cookies.txt",
)

# Get track with lyrics (requires authentication)
track = client.get_track("https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")
lyrics = client.get_lyrics(track["id"])
print(lyrics["text"])
```

## üîÑ Migrating from 1.x

If you're upgrading from version 1.x, here are the key changes:

```python
# Old way (1.x)
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request

request = Request().request()
track_info = Scraper(session=request).get_track_url_info(url='https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')

# New way (2.x)
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()
track_info = client.get_track('https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')
```

For backward compatibility, the old API is still available:

```python
# Backward compatibility
from spotify_scraper.compat import Scraper, Request

request = Request().request()
track_info = Scraper(session=request).get_track_url_info(url='https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')
```
