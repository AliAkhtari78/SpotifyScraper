**SpotifyScraper** is a powerful, modern Python library that extracts rich metadata from Spotify's web interface without requiring API credentials. Built for developers who need reliable access to Spotify's public data, it offers a clean, type-safe API with comprehensive media download capabilities.

## üåü Why SpotifyScraper?

- **No API Key Required**: Access Spotify data without dealing with API registration, rate limits, or quotas
- **Rich Data Extraction**: Get comprehensive metadata including preview URLs, cover art, lyrics, and more
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested with robust error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript-style type hints for excellent IDE support and fewer runtime errors
- **Media Downloads**: Built-in high-quality audio preview and cover art downloading with metadata
- **Flexible Architecture**: Choose between lightweight requests or powerful Selenium backends
- **Modern Python**: Async support, context managers, and clean pythonic interfaces

print(f"Track: {track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']}")

# Download preview
file_path = client.download_preview(track["id"])
print(f"Downloaded preview to {file_path}")

## üìö API Reference

### SpotifyClient

The main interface for interacting with Spotify content.

```python
class SpotifyClient:
    def __init__(
        self,
        auth_token: Optional[str] = None,
        cookie_file: Optional[str] = None,
        proxy: Optional[str] = None,
        timeout: int = 30,
        max_retries: int = 3,
        config: Optional[Config] = None,
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize Spotify client with optional authentication and configuration."""
```

#### Key Methods

| Method | Description | Returns |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `get_track(url_or_id)` | Extract track metadata | `TrackDict` |
| `get_album(url_or_id)` | Extract album with all tracks | `AlbumDict` |
| `get_artist(url_or_id)` | Extract artist profile | `ArtistDict` |
| `get_playlist(url_or_id)` | Extract playlist tracks | `PlaylistDict` |
| `get_lyrics(track_id)` | Get song lyrics (auth required) | `LyricsDict` |
| `download_preview(track_id, **kwargs)` | Download track preview MP3 | `str` (file path) |
| `download_cover(entity_id, **kwargs)` | Download cover art | `str` (file path) |
| `search(query, limit, type)` | Search Spotify content | `SearchResults` |

### Data Types

All returned data uses TypedDict for type safety:

```python
from spotify_scraper.types import TrackDict, AlbumDict, ArtistDict

# Type hints provide IDE support
track: TrackDict = client.get_track("...")
print(track["name"])  # IDE knows this is a string
print(track["duration_ms"])  # IDE knows this is an int
```

## üîÑ Migration from v1.x

If you're upgrading from version 1.x, here are the key changes:

```python
# Old way (1.x)
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request

request = Request().request()
track_info = Scraper(session=request).get_track_url_info(url='https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')

# New way (2.x)
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()
track_info = client.get_track('https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')
```

For backward compatibility, the old API is still available:

```python
# Backward compatibility
from spotify_scraper.compat import Scraper, Request

request = Request().request()
track_info = Scraper(session=request).get_track_url_info(url='https://open.spotify.com/track/7wqpAYuSk84f0JeqCIETRV')
```

### Key Changes in v2.0

1. **New API Structure**: Simplified client-based approach
2. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout
3. **Better Error Handling**: Detailed exceptions with recovery hints
4. **Improved Performance**: Connection pooling and caching
5. **Media Download**: Built-in download capabilities
6. **Async Support**: Optional async/await patterns

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.
