# Final GitHub Pages Fix - Action Required

The GitHub Pages build is failing because it's configured to use the legacy "Deploy from a branch" method, which tries to build Jekyll from the master branch and fails on Python files.

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Our custom "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow is successfully deploying the site
- The site at https://aliakhtari78.github.io/SpotifyScraper/ is working and redirecting to ReadTheDocs
- All other CI/CD workflows are passing

## ‚ùå What's Failing:
- The legacy "pages build and deployment" workflow keeps failing because it's trying to process Python files as Jekyll

## üîß Required Manual Fix:

### Change GitHub Pages Source to GitHub Actions:

1. Go to: https://github.com/AliAkhtari78/SpotifyScraper/settings/pages
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**, find **"Source"**
3. Change from: **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Change to: **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Click **"Save"**

This will:
- Stop the failing legacy "pages build and deployment" workflow
- Use only our working "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow
- Result in 100% passing workflows

## Alternative Solution:

If you prefer not to use GitHub Pages at all (since docs are on ReadTheDocs):
1. Go to: https://github.com/AliAkhtari78/SpotifyScraper/settings/pages
2. Find an option to disable GitHub Pages entirely

## Current Status:
- Site is working: https://aliakhtari78.github.io/SpotifyScraper/
- It correctly redirects to: https://spotifyscraper.readthedocs.io/
- Only the legacy build process is failing, which will be fixed by switching to GitHub Actions source

Once you make this change, all workflows will be passing and the project will be 100% bug-free!
