# SpotifyScraper Development Notes

This file tracks improvements and changes made to the SpotifyScraper library.

## Recent Improvements (June 9, 2025)

### Version 2.1.4 Enhancements

#### 1. **Firefox Browser Support** ✅
- Added `browser_name` parameter to `SeleniumBrowser` class
- Supports both Chrome (default) and Firefox browsers
- Firefox-specific options and preferences configured
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Commit: 5bb7089

#### 2. **Automatic Driver Management** ✅
- Added `webdriver-manager>=4.0.0` to optional selenium dependencies
- Enables automatic download and management of browser drivers
- No more manual ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver installation required
- Falls back gracefully if webdriver-manager not installed

#### 3. **Enhanced Data Extraction** ✅
Added support for extracting additional metadata fields:
- **Track fields**: `track_number` (available in album context), `disc_number`, `popularity`
- **Artist fields**: external `url` links
- **Album fields**: `total_tracks` count
- **Additional**: `content_rating`, external URLs

**Important Implementation Note**: 
- JSON parser enhanced to extract `track_number`, `disc_number`, and `popularity` fields
- Testing revealed: `track_number` is available when tracks are accessed via albums
- `disc_number` and `popularity` fields are NOT present in web HTML data
- These fields require Spotify API access for full availability

#### 4. **Code Quality** ✅
- All code formatted with Black
- Import ordering fixed with isort
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Comprehensive testing completed

### Technical Details

#### New Data Fields Example
```python
track_data = {
    'track_number': 5,         # Position in album (when available)
    'disc_number': 1,          # Disc number (when available)
    'popularity': 85,          # Spotify popularity (requires API)
    'url': 'https://...',      # External Spotify URL
    'artists': [{
        'url': 'https://...'   # Artist Spotify URL
    }],
    'album': {
        'total_tracks': 12     # Total tracks in album
    }
}
```

### Testing Results
- ✅ Track extraction with new fields (parser implementation verified)
- ✅ Album extraction with total_tracks and track_number for contained tracks
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ All CI/CD checks passing
- ✅ Real-world testing confirms field availability limitations

### Data Availability Summary

Based on comprehensive testing:

**Available via Web Scraping:**
- Basic track info (name, id, uri, duration, explicit)
- Artist names and IDs
- Album names and basic info
- Track listings with track_number (in album context)
- Preview URLs
- Cover images
- Release dates

**NOT Available via Web Scraping (Require API):**
- Popularity scores
- Follower counts
- Monthly listeners
- Genres
- Market availability
- Copyright/label info (limited)
- Audio features
- Artist verification status

### Future Improvements
1. Implement proxy support for web scraping
2. Add async/concurrent extraction capabilities  
3. Create comprehensive integration test suite
4. Explore alternative data sources
5. Add GUI/Web interface
6. Consider hybrid approach with Spotify API for complete data

## Latest Update - Enhanced Field Extraction Implementation

### JSON Parser Enhancements (June 9, 2025)

Successfully implemented extraction for additional track metadata fields in `json_parser.py`:
- Added `track_number` extraction (lines 356-360)
- Added `disc_number` extraction (lines 362-366)
- Added `popularity` extraction (lines 368-370)

### Real-World Testing Results

Testing with actual Spotify URLs revealed:

1. **track_number**: ✅ Available
   - Successfully extracted when tracks are accessed via album context
   - Not available for individual track URLs
   - Album extractor properly assigns track numbers

2. **disc_number**: ⚠️ Parser ready but data not available
   - Parser implementation complete
   - Field not present in Spotify's web HTML data
   - Would require API access

3. **popularity**: ⚠️ Parser ready but data not available
   - Parser implementation complete
   - Field not present in Spotify's web HTML data
   - Would require API access

### Code Changes Summary
```python
# In extract_track_data() method:
# Extract track number if available
if "trackNumber" in track_data:
    result["track_number"] = track_data["trackNumber"]
elif "track_number" in track_data:
    result["track_number"] = track_data["track_number"]

# Extract disc number if available
if "discNumber" in track_data:
    result["disc_number"] = track_data["discNumber"]
elif "disc_number" in track_data:
    result["disc_number"] = track_data["disc_number"]

# Extract popularity if available
if "popularity" in track_data:
    result["popularity"] = track_data["popularity"]
```

The library now has complete infrastructure to extract these fields when/if they become available through web scraping or alternative data sources.
