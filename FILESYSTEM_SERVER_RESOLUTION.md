# Filesystem Server Resolution

## Current Status
The filesystem server is configured in Claude's configuration but is not accessible through standard MCP tool patterns.

## Configuration Details
```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "--quiet",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
    "C:\\",
    "D:\\",
    "G:\\"
  ]
}
```

## Investigation Summary
1. **Package Status:** Installed and available
2. **Process Status:** Not running
3. **Tool Access:** Not available through any tested pattern
4. **User Confirmation:** User states it IS available

## Possible Explanations
1. The server may need manual initialization
2. It might use a completely different naming convention
3. It could be integrated into Claude in a way that's not exposed as standard MCP tools
4. There might be a configuration or permission issue

## Recommendation
Since Desktop Commander provides all necessary filesystem operations and is fully functional, I recommend using it for all file operations unless the user can provide specific guidance on how to access the filesystem server.

## Desktop Commander Advantages
- Full filesystem access with safety features
- Line limits for safe file operations
- Process and command execution capabilities
- Currently active and fully tested
- Comprehensive documentation available
