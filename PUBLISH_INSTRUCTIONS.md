# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Release üè∑Ô∏è

```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "SpotifyScraper v2.0.0 - Complete Rewrite

Major release featuring:
- Modern Python architecture with type safety
- CLI interface with rich terminal output  
- Media download capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready automation

See RELEASE_NOTES.md for full details."

# Push the tag
git push origin v2.0.0

# Create GitHub release (requires gh CLI)
gh release create v2.0.0 \
  --title "SpotifyScraper v2.0.0 - Complete Rewrite" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md \
  --prerelease=false \
  dist/spotifyscraper-2.0.0.tar.gz \
  dist/spotifyscraper-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Step 3: Publish to PyPI üì¶

### Option A: Using twine (Recommended)

```bash
# Activate the build environment
source package_build_env/bin/activate

# Upload to PyPI (you'll need PyPI credentials)
twine upload dist/*

# Follow prompts for username (__token__) and API token
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Actions (Automated)

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically publish to PyPI when you create a release, but you need to set up the PyPI API token first:

1. Go to PyPI.org and create an API token
2. Add it as a GitHub secret named `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
3. The workflow will automatically trigger on release creation

## Step 4: Verify Publication ‚úÖ

```bash
# Test installation from PyPI
pip install spotifyscraper==2.0.0

# Run quick test
python -c "from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient; print('‚úÖ Package installed successfully!')"

# Test CLI
spotify-scraper --help
```

## üîß Post-Publication Tasks

### Update Documentation Links
```bash
# Update any documentation that references version numbers
# Update badge URLs in README.md if needed
# Verify all links work correctly
```

### Announce Release
- [ ] Update project homepage
- [ ] Post on relevant Python communities
- [ ] Update package description if needed
- [ ] Share with users of v1.x for migration

### Monitor & Maintain
- [ ] Watch for issues and bug reports
- [ ] Monitor download statistics
- [ ] Plan v2.1 features based on feedback

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Credentials Required**: You need PyPI credentials (API token) to publish
2. **One-time Operation**: Version 2.0.0 can only be published once to PyPI
3. **Testing**: Consider publishing to TestPyPI first for validation
4. **Backup**: The `dist/` folder contains the distribution files

### Test PyPI (Optional)
```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI first (recommended)
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ spotifyscraper==2.0.0
```
