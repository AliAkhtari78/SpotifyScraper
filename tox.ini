# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# `envlist` chooses the build environments to test with the main `testenv`.
# The pyXX environments are built in, but custom environments (testenv:XX)
# must be added manually to the test suite (envlist)
