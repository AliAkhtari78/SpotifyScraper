"""Client module for the SpotifyScraper package.

This module provides the main entry point for users of the SpotifyScraper library.
The SpotifyClient class offers a high-level, user-friendly interface for extracting
data from Spotify's web player, including tracks, albums, artists, and playlists.

The client handles all the complexity of web scraping, including:
    - Browser management (requests vs Selenium)
    - Authentication and session handling
    - URL validation and conversion
    - Data extraction and parsing
    - Media downloading (audio previews and cover images)
    - Error handling and logging

Example:
    >>> from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient
    >>> client = SpotifyClient()
    >>> track_info = client.get_track_info("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
    >>> print(track_info['name'])

class SpotifyClient:
    """High-level client for interacting with Spotify web player.

    This class provides a simplified, user-friendly interface for extracting
    information from Spotify's web player and downloading related media files.
    It abstracts away the complexity of web scraping and provides clean methods
    for common operations.

    The client supports extracting data from:
        - Tracks (including lyrics with authentication)
        - Albums (with full track listings)
        - Artists (including top tracks and discography)
        - Playlists (with all track details)

    It also supports downloading:
        - Audio preview clips (30-second MP3s)
        - Cover images in various sizes

    Attributes:
        session: Authentication session for accessing protected content.
        scraper: Core scraper instance that handles web interactions.
        browser: Browser backend (requests or Selenium) for fetching pages.
        track_extractor: Specialized extractor for track data.
        album_extractor: Specialized extractor for album data.
        artist_extractor: Specialized extractor for artist data.
        playlist_extractor: Specialized extractor for playlist data.

    Example:
        Basic usage without authentication::

            client = SpotifyClient()
            track = client.get_track_info("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
            print(f"{track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']}")

        With authentication for lyrics::

            client = SpotifyClient(cookie_file="spotify_cookies.txt")
            track = client.get_track_info_with_lyrics(track_url)
            print(track['lyrics'])

        Download media files::

            # Download 30-second preview
            client.download_preview_mp3(track_url, path="previews/")

            # Download album cover
            client.download_cover(album_url, path="covers/", size="large")

    Note:
        Authentication via cookies is required for some features like lyrics.
        The library will work without authentication for most metadata extraction.
