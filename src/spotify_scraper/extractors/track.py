"""Track extractor module for SpotifyScraper.

This module provides specialized functionality for extracting track information
from Spotify's web interface. It handles parsing of Spotify's React-based pages
to extract structured track metadata, including basic information, audio previews,
and optionally lyrics (with authentication).

The extractor intelligently converts regular Spotify URLs to embed format for
better reliability and to avoid authentication requirements for basic metadata.

Example:
    >>> from spotify_scraper.browsers import create_browser
    >>> from spotify_scraper.extractors.track import TrackExtractor
    >>>
    >>> browser = create_browser("requests")
    >>> extractor = TrackExtractor(browser)
    >>> track_data = extractor.extract("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
    >>> print(f"{track_data['name']} - {track_data['artists'][0]['name']}")

class TrackExtractor:
    """Extractor for Spotify track information.

    This class specializes in extracting track metadata from Spotify's web pages.
    It handles the complexity of parsing Spotify's React-based interface and
    provides clean, structured data output.

    The extractor automatically converts regular Spotify URLs to embed format
    (/embed/track/...) which provides several advantages:
        - No authentication required for basic metadata
        - More consistent page structure
        - Faster page loads
        - Same data availability as regular pages

    Attributes:
        browser: Browser instance for fetching web pages and handling requests.

    Example:
        >>> browser = create_browser("requests")
        >>> extractor = TrackExtractor(browser)
        >>>
        >>> # Extract by URL
        >>> track = extractor.extract("https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")
        >>> print(track['name'])  # "Bohemian Rhapsody"
        >>>
        >>> # Extract by ID
        >>> track = extractor.extract_by_id("6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6")
        >>>
        >>> # Get preview URL
        >>> preview_url = extractor.extract_preview_url(track_url)
        >>> print(f"Preview: {preview_url}")

    Note:
        While this extractor can parse lyrics when available in the page data,
        official Spotify lyrics typically require authentication to access.
        Use the SpotifyClient with proper authentication for reliable lyrics access.
