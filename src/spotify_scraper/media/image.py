"""Image downloading and processing module for SpotifyScraper.

This module handles the downloading of cover images from Spotify entities
including tracks (album covers), albums, artists, and playlists. It provides
functionality to download images in various sizes with automatic filename
generation and path management.

The module supports all Spotify entity types and intelligently extracts
the appropriate image URL from the entity data structure.

Example:
    >>> from spotify_scraper.browsers import create_browser
    >>> from spotify_scraper.media.image import ImageDownloader
    >>> from spotify_scraper.extractors.track import TrackExtractor
    >>>
    >>> browser = create_browser("requests")
    >>> downloader = ImageDownloader(browser)
    >>> extractor = TrackExtractor(browser)
    >>>
    >>> track_data = extractor.extract("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
    >>> cover_path = downloader.download_cover(track_data, size="large")
    >>> print(f"Cover saved to: {cover_path}")

    """Download and process cover images from Spotify.

    This class specializes in downloading cover art images from various Spotify
    entities. It handles the complete download process including URL extraction,
    size selection, filename generation, and file saving.

    The downloader supports:
        - Track album covers
        - Album covers
        - Artist images
        - Playlist covers
        - Multiple image sizes (small, medium, large)
        - Automatic filename sanitization
        - Custom paths and filenames

    Attributes:
        browser: Browser instance for web interactions (though primarily uses
            direct requests for image downloads).

    Example:
        >>> downloader = ImageDownloader(browser)
        >>> # Download track's album cover
        >>> track_data = track_extractor.extract(track_url)
        >>> cover_path = downloader.download_cover(track_data)

        Image quality and available sizes depend on what Spotify provides.

                Special characters are sanitized for filesystem compatibility.
            path: Directory path where the image should be saved.
                Defaults to current directory. Directory will be created
                if it doesn't exist.
            size: Preferred image size to download.
                - "small": Smallest available (typically 64x64)

        Raises:
            DownloadError: If no cover image is available or download fails.
                Includes the URL and file path in the error for debugging.

        Example:
