"""SpotifyScraper - Modern Spotify Web Scraper.

A fast, modern Python library for extracting data from Spotify's web player.
Supports tracks, albums, artists, playlists, and lyrics with both requests and
Selenium backends.

This package provides a high-level interface for extracting metadata from Spotify's
web player without requiring API authentication. It parses Spotify's React-based
web interface to extract structured data.

Key Features:
    - Extract metadata for tracks, albums, artists, and playlists
    - Download preview audio clips and cover images
    - Support for both lightweight (requests) and full (Selenium) browsers
    - No API key required - works with public Spotify web pages
    - Type-safe data structures using TypedDict
    - Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types

Typical usage example:
    from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

    # Create a client
    client = SpotifyClient()

    # Extract track information
    track_data = client.get_track_info("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
    print(f"Track: {track_data['name']} by {track_data['artists'][0]['name']}")

    # Download preview and cover
    client.download_preview_mp3(track_url, path="downloads/")
    client.download_cover(track_url, path="covers/")

For authenticated features (e.g., lyrics), provide cookies:
    client = SpotifyClient(cookie_file="cookies.txt")
    track_with_lyrics = client.get_track_info_with_lyrics(track_url)

Note:
    This library is designed for educational and personal use. Always respect
    Spotify's Terms of Service and robots.txt when using this library.
