## Usage Questions

### How do I extract track information?
```python
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()
track = client.get_track_info("https://open.spotify.com/track/...")
print(track['name'], track['artists'][0]['name'])
```

### Can I extract multiple items at once?
Yes, but process them sequentially to avoid rate limits:
```python
urls = [url1, url2, url3]
results = []

for url in urls:
    data = client.get_track_info(url)
    results.append(data)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Be respectful
```

### How do I know what type of URL I have?
```python
from spotify_scraper import is_spotify_url, extract_id

if is_spotify_url(url):
    spotify_id = extract_id(url)
    # URL is valid
```

### Can I use Spotify URIs instead of URLs?
Currently, SpotifyScraper works with URLs. Convert URIs to URLs:
```python
# Convert spotify:track:ID to URL
track_id = "6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6"
url = f"https://open.spotify.com/track/{track_id}"
```

## Authentication & Cookies

### Do I need a Spotify account?
No account is needed for basic features. However, some features (like lyrics) require authentication via cookies.

### How do I get cookies for authentication?
1. Install a browser extension like "cookies.txt"
2. Log into Spotify Web Player
3. Export cookies to a file
4. Use with SpotifyScraper:
```python
client = SpotifyClient(cookie_file="spotify_cookies.txt")
```

### How long do cookies last?
Spotify cookies typically last 1 year, but may expire sooner if:
- You log out
- You change your password
- Spotify invalidates them

### Can I use my Spotify API credentials?
No, SpotifyScraper doesn't use Spotify's official API. It works by parsing the web player interface.

## Data Extraction

### Why is the album name empty for tracks?
This is a limitation of Spotify's embed API. Track data from embed URLs doesn't include album names, though album images are always available. This is not a bug but a Spotify limitation.

### What data can I extract?

#### Tracks
- Title, artists, duration
- Album (images only, name may be empty)
- Preview URL (if available)
- Release date
- Track number
- Explicit flag
- Lyrics (requires auth)

#### Albums
- Title, artists, release date
- All tracks with details
- Cover images
- Total track count

#### Artists
- Name, genres, popularity
- Biography
- Top tracks
- Monthly listeners
- Images

#### Playlists
- Name, description, owner
- All tracks
- Total duration
- Cover image

### Can I get user-specific data?
No, SpotifyScraper only accesses publicly available data. It cannot access:
- Private playlists
- User libraries
- Listening history
- Personal recommendations

### How accurate is the data?
The data comes directly from Spotify's web player, so it's as accurate as what Spotify displays. However, some fields may be:
- Region-specific
- Subject to change
- Unavailable for certain content

---

## Media Downloads

### What audio quality are the previews?
Spotify provides 30-second previews in:
- Format: MP3
- Bitrate: 96-128 kbps
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz

### Can I download full songs?
No, SpotifyScraper only downloads the preview clips that Spotify makes publicly available. It does not and cannot download full tracks.

### What image sizes are available?
Cover images typically come in three sizes:
- Small: 64x64
- Medium: 300x300
- Large: 640x640

### How do I embed metadata in downloads?
```python
# Download with metadata embedding
path = client.download_preview_mp3(
    url,
    path="downloads/",
    with_cover=True  # Embeds cover art
)
```

### Where are files saved?
By default, files are saved to the current directory. Specify a path:
```python
# Save to specific directory
client.download_preview_mp3(url, path="my_music/previews/")
client.download_cover(url, path="my_music/covers/")
```

## Performance & Scaling

### How can I speed up extraction?
1. **Reuse client instances** - Don't create new clients for each request
2. **Use requests backend** - Faster than Selenium for most cases
3. **Implement caching** - Store results to avoid repeated requests
4. **Parallel processing** - Use with caution and rate limiting

### What are the rate limits?
Spotify doesn't publish exact limits, but general guidelines:
- Keep requests under 10/minute for safety
- Add delays between requests (0.5-1 second)
- Monitor for 429 (rate limit) errors

### Can I run this in production?
Yes, but consider:
- Implement proper error handling
- Add retry logic with backoff
- Monitor rate limits
- Use caching
- Consider Spotify's ToS

### How do I handle large-scale extraction?
```python
import time
from typing import List

def batch_extract(urls: List[str], delay: float = 1.0):
    """Extract data with rate limiting."""
    client = SpotifyClient()
    results = []
    
    for i, url in enumerate(urls):
        try:
            data = client.get_track_info(url)
            results.append(data)
            
            # Progress
            print(f"Processed {i+1}/{len(urls)}")
            
            # Rate limit
            if i < len(urls) - 1:
                time.sleep(delay)
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed: {url} - {e}")
            results.append(None)
    
    return results
```
