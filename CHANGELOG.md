### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### Quick Migration

The fastest way to migrate is to update your imports:

```python
# Old (v1.x)
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request

# New (v2.0) - Compatibility mode
from spotify_scraper.compat import Scraper, Request
```

#### Recommended Migration

For the best experience, migrate to the new API:

```python
# Old way (v1.x)
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request

request = Request().request()
scraper = Scraper(session=request)

# Get track info
track_info = scraper.get_track_url_info(
    url='https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6'
)

# Download preview
scraper.download_track(track_id='6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6')
```

```python
# New way (v2.0)
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient()

# Get track info - cleaner API
track = client.get_track('https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6')

# Download preview - more options
path = client.download_preview(
    track_id='6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6',

python --version  # Must be 3.8 or higher
```

#### Step 2: Update Package
```bash
# Uninstall old version
pip uninstall SpotifyScraper

# Install new version
pip install spotifyscraper>=2.0.0
```

#### Step 3: Update Code

Option A - Quick fix (use compatibility layer):
```python
# Change this line:
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request

# To this:
from spotify_scraper.compat import Scraper, Request
```

Option B - Full migration (recommended):
```python
# Old
from SpotifyScraper.scraper import Scraper, Request
req = Request().request()
scraper = Scraper(session=req)
track = scraper.get_track_url_info(url="...")

# New 
from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient
client = SpotifyClient()
track = client.get_track("...")
```

#### Step 4: Test
```bash
# Run your tests
pytest

# Or test manually
python -c "from spotify_scraper import SpotifyClient; print('Import successful!')"
```
